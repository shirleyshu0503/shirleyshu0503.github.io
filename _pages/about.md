Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Economics, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE).

I received my Ph.D. in Economics at Brown University in 2025. My research interests lie in development and environmental economics, with a focus on climate change adaptation, green transition, and the impacts of environmental policies. 

Most of my work involves field experiment and primary data collection, with ongoing projects in sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Uganda) and China, supported by the [IGC](https://www.theigc.org/) and [PEDL)](https://pedl.cepr.org/).

Here is my [CV](https://shirleyshu0503.github.io/files/CV_YunyuShu.pdf).

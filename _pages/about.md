Welcome!

I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics at Brown University in 2025.

My research interests lie in development economics and environmental economics, focusing on climate adaptation, green energy transition, and enforcement of environmental regulations. 

My work involves field experiments, primary data collection, and secondary data analysis. My ongoing projects cover sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya) and China, supported by the [International Growth Centre (IGC)](https://www.theigc.org/) and [Private Entreprise Development in Low-income Countries (PEDL)](https://pedl.cepr.org/).

Here is my [CV](https://shirleyshu0503.github.io/files/CV_YunyuShu.pdf).

Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Economics, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE).

I received my Ph.D. in Economics at Brown University in 2025. My research interests lie in development and environmental economics. Most of my work involves field experiment and primary data collection, with ongoing projects in sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Uganda) and China, supported by the [IGC](https://www.theigc.org/) and [PEDL)](https://pedl.cepr.org/).

Please email me your CV if you are interested in RA.
